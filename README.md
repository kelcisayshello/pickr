# Pickr â€” Eye Dropper Chrome Extension Tool

Pickr is a minimalistic Chrome Extension tool I built to experiment with designing my own Chrome Extensions using [Manifest V3](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/intro/). Pickr also saves your most recently used colors in local memory so you can revisit your palette later (if need be).
