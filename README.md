# Pickr â€” Eye Dropper Chrome Extension Tool

Pickr is a minimalistic Chrome Extension tool that I built to experiment with designing my own Chrome Extensions using [Manifest V3](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/intro/). Like most eye dropper tools, Pickr grabs the colors off of *almost* any* web page. Pickr then saves your recently grabbed colors into local memory so you can revisit your palette later (if need be).

(*) As of August 2023, Pickr does not support access on the following pages:
* Chrome pages (settings, web store, extensions page, etc.)
* Behance.net
* Any local pages

### Quick Fix
If for any reason the eye dropper tool does not appear when you select **Pick a color**, refresh the page first before using the extension. If the problem persists then you can let me know by [creating an issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue).
